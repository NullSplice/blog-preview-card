# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the **Blog Preview Card** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It helped me practice semantic HTML, scoped CSS, Flexbox alignement, and dealing with CSS specificity.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML** (article, h1, time)
- **CSS** custom properties
- Flexbox (for the author row)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts - Figtree

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Selector mismatch hurts fast: I styled .avatar in CSS but used id="avatar" in HTML, so nothing applied.

- Scope image rules: A genetic rule like .card img { ... } hit both the hero image and the avatar.

- Valid links % accessibility: a link="none" isn't valid--use a href="#".../a

---

## 🔮 Continued Development

- Practice responsive type and spacing with rem
- Add richer focus states and test with the keyboard
- Explore container queries for component-level responsiveness
